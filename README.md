## Ahoy and Servus ðŸ‘‹
I'm an [associacte professor](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/staff/sebastianmutz/) at the University of Glasgow with a focus on climate and Earth system dynamics, climate change impacts, and the development of methods and tools for research and science communication. My toolbox includes process-based models (e.g., global climate models), empirical-statistical models, and techniques from AI. I currently serve as manager of [ExaGEO](https://www.exageo.org/) (NERC Doctoral Landscape Award in Exascale Computing for Earth, Environmental, and Sustainability Solutions), on the steering committee of the [ESM-AI](https://sages.ac.uk/research/fora/earth-system-modelling-artificial-intelligence-esm-ai/) forum of SAGES (Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society), on the [EGU-OC](https://www.egu.eu/outreach/) (European Geosciences Union Outreach Committee), and as a topical editor for the journals Earth System Dynamics and Geoscience Communication.

## Climate Dynamics Lab ðŸŒ€
The [Climate Dynamics Lab](https://mutz.science/) is a small, international network of scientists clustered around specific research topics (see [list of publications](https://mutz.science/res/pub.html)). It keeps an open-door policy to anyone interested in working on these topics (as a researcher, developer or communicator). [Get in touch](mailto:sebastian@mutz.science) if you have questions, comments, or would like to join us!
