Hi there and servus, ðŸ‘‹

I'm an associacte professor (senior lecturer) at the University of Glasgow with research focus on climate and Earth system dynamics, climate change impacts, and the development of methods and tools for research and science communication. My research tools include process-based models (e.g., global climate models), empirical-statistical models, and techniques from AI. I currently serve as manager of ExaGEO (NERC Doctoral Landscape Award in Exascale Computing for Earth, Environmental, and Sustainability Solutions), on the steering committee of the Earth System Modelling and Artificial Intelligence (ESM-AI) forum of SAGES (Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society), on the EGU (European Geosciences Union) Outreach Committee, and as a topical editor for the journals Earth System Dynamics and Geoscience Communication.

The Climate Dynamics Lab is a small, international network of researchers clustered around specific research topics. It keeps an open-door policy to anyone working on these topics. If you have questions, comments, or would like to join us: get in touch!

![ESM-AI](https://sages.ac.uk/wp-content/smush-webp/2025/02/ESM-AI_Logo.png.webp)
The Forum for Earth System Modelling & Artificial Intelligence (ESM-AI) has the overarching aim to advance current understanding of the inner working of the Earth system, of its variations under climate change, and of the impacts this will bring about, using modelling and data-driven approaches.
