## BIO

Hi there and servus, ðŸ‘‹

I'm an associacte professor (senior lecturer) at the University of Glasgow with research focus on climate and Earth system dynamics, climate change impacts, and the development of methods and tools for research and science communication. My research tools include process-based models (e.g., global climate models), empirical-statistical models, and techniques from AI. I currently serve as manager of ExaGEO (NERC Doctoral Landscape Award in Exascale Computing for Earth, Environmental, and Sustainability Solutions), on the steering committee of the Earth System Modelling and Artificial Intelligence (ESM-AI) forum of SAGES (Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society), on the EGU (European Geosciences Union) Outreach Committee, and as a topical editor for the journals Earth System Dynamics and Geoscience Communication.

The Climate Dynamics Lab is a small, international network of researchers clustered around specific research topics. As such, it keeps an open-door policy to anyone working on these topics who shares some core values, namely (a) research integrity and commitment to the pursuit of knowledge, (b) commitment to open science, and (c) respect for peers and community. If you have questions or comments, get in touch.
